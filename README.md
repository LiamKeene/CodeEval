## CodeEval
> My solutions for the challenges on [CodeEval](https://www.codeeval.com/open_challenges/)

### About
The challenge solutions are in directories corresponding to the language used
to solve them.  Most of the solutions are in Python, my preferred language, but
I aim to add solutions in Ruby and Javascript, which I'm really keen on at the
moment.

### Usage
The challenge inputs are in the ```Inputs``` folder and are named to correspond
to the challenge, for example ```challenge1.py```.  The inputs are the sample
inputs that are written on each challenge web page and are not neccessarily the
full set of test inputs that are used by CodeEval to evaulate a solution.

To run a solution;
```shell
python Python/challenge1.py Inputs/challenge1.in
ruby Ruby/challenge20.rb Inputs/challenge20.in
```

A lot of solutions are extremely trivial in Python, such as converting a string
to.  These solutions most likely don't have any separate functions or documentation.
